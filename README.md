# Project Overview

This repository contains two chatbot projects:

1. College Admission Chatbot
This chatbot is designed to assist users with college admission queries. It provides information about admission procedures, requirements, and deadlines based on a provided PDF document. The chatbot engages users in a conversational flow, allowing multiple questions within a single session. Additionally, it maintains conversation history for improved interaction.

2. Simple Chatbot
This chatbot offers basic conversational capabilities. It greets users, provides farewell messages, and maintains conversation history. The chatbot is designed to be friendly and provide appropriate responses even when it doesn't understand user input.

## Features

 - Remembers Previous Chats: The chatbot can recall past interactions to provide more relevant responses.
 - Friendly Responses: When the chatbot does not understand the user's input, it responds in a friendly manner to keep the conversation engaging.
 - Greeting and Farewell: The chatbot greets users at the beginning of the conversation and bids farewell when the user says goodbye.

## Usage

Once the chatbot is running, you can start interacting with it through the command line. The chatbot will greet you when you first start the conversation and will remember your past interactions. You can type your messages, and the chatbot will respond accordingly. If it doesn't understand your input, it will provide a friendly response. To end the conversation, you can say "goodbye," and the chatbot will bid you farewell.
